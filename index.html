         In the game that just came out 
            recently fifa 23 the last
             fifa with EA in it. Has alot of 
             new features in it like power shots 
             and new graphics and the chemistry system is 
              different as well as it feels more realistic
              in previous fifas players were fast and they would do all
              types of things there still are fast players but also has things 
             that we have seen in previous  
             fifa games like Fut champs, divison 
             rivals, and  frienldy matches.
