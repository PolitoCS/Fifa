            When playing friendlys theres alot of ups in it
            You can play with AI and you can choose your own dificulty 
            from beginer to legendary. Besides AI you can also connect a few 
            more controllers and play in one screen up to 4 players on each team
            and you can choose any team from the premier league, la liga,
            Mens/Women national teams etc.My favorite mode is the cup mode you can 
            play a mode where is like battling out for  cups like world cup 
            champions league and many more.
